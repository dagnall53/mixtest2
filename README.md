# mixtest2
second test of mixer, using spiffs

The example "works" as is, 
Plays a pizzicato scale repeatedly with silence on other channel,
Then plays an arpeggio on the other channel at the same time. and after a few plays turns off the scales.


but: Sound quality is poor, sounds "wobbly", as though the samples were not being added properly? or were modulated by the mixer?

Sound quality of the samples is fine if played directly to the DAC ouput.
